         WATERFALL
           CHARACTERISTICS
            Sequential Phases: Waterfall follows a linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins (e.g., Requirements -> Design -> Implementation -            > Testing -> Maintenance).

           Fixed Scope: Project scope and requirements are defined at the beginning and are usually not changed throughout the project.

         Advantages:

           Clear Structure: The defined stages and milestones make it easy to understand and manage.

           Predictability: Well-suited for projects with clear, stable requirements. Time, cost, and scope can be accurately estimated at the beginning.

          Documentation: Extensive documentation helps in maintaining the project over time and understanding the project lifecycle.

      Disadvantages:

          Inflexibility: Changes are difficult and costly to implement once the project is underway.

          Delayed Testing: Testing is often left until late in the project, which can lead to finding issues at a stage where they are more expensive to fix.

          Slow Adaptation: Not well-suited for projects where requirements are expected to evolve or where rapid changes are needed. 
          
      AGILE METHODOLOGY:
     CHARACTERISTICS

          Iterative and Incremental: Agile works in small, iterative cycles called sprints, allowing for frequent reassessment and adaptation of plans.

          Flexible Scope: Requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between cross-functional teams and stakeholders.

    Advantages:

        Flexibility and Adaptation: Agile can quickly adapt to changes in project requirements, making it ideal for dynamic and complex projects.
